Brown Sugar Fudge
By Grammy Russell

2 cups Brown Sugar
1 can Milk
1 pinch Salt
1 pinch Cream of Tarter
1 tsp Butter
1 tsp Vanilla

Boil over medium heat, stir until sugar is melted. Test in cold water until ball forms. Cool 10 mins
Pour into greased pan.

Hint: use parchment paper to line your pans. So much easier to clean up.
